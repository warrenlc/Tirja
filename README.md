This is my language playground for what will be the language Tirja.

I have decided to do a handmade parser. This could take a while as I have no idea what I am doing. 
I am still unsure if I will use C or C++ or even something else. 

This will take a while...

Tirja is pronounced TEER-YAH and was my best friend (border collie)

    So far only a tokenizer I am working on is available in the directory ./lexer/
