This is my language playground for what will be the language Tirja.

This will start as moving an earlier project, "Whisper" here which is using flex, bison, C and will evolve to be Tirja.
So things will be called Whisper for awhile until I tear enough down/rebuild enough to be Tirja. 

Tirja is pronounced TEER-YAH and was my best friend (border collie)
